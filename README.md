# Todo app coding challenge

This application was created as part of a take-home coding test for a senior front end engineering position. In a production environment I likely would have opted to start using create-next-app since CRA is officially deprecated, but this application is tiny enough that I didn't think it was necessary to add server-side or SEO optimization in next.

Likewise in a production environment I'd likely be working with a component library. However since this a tiny app I opted to create both the components and the css from scratch. Again because the application is tiny I 
opted for straight CSS - in a larger application I'd likely add sass for ease of coding and use a combination
of global variables for ease of standardization and css modules to avoid style and namespace collisions. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is NOT ejected - do so at your own risk!

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Roadmap
- Replace the checkbox element in the Todo component with one that both matches designs and is accessibility-friendly.
